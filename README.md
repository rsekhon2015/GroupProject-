# GroupProject

###### Group Members: Ben Howland and Ranjit Sekhon


#### Plan so far
* App to find nearest schools, gas station, bars, restaurant, and food
* Use the google places API
* We talk about a 3 mi radius


#### Ideas
* Have a print out of the places in an XML format
* For options they could put the address and either: all, 1, 2, or 3 of the places
* Maybe a method of having the nearest of any of the options

#### Random Stuff
