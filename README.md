# GroupProject-

  ###### Group Members: Ben Howland and Ranjit Sekhon


  #### Plan so far
  * App to find nearest schools, gas station, bars, restaurant, and food
  * Use the google places API
  * We talk about a 3 mi radius


  #### Ideas
  * Not only just a map but have a print out of the places in an XML format
  * For options they could put the address and either: all, 1, 2, or 3 of the places
  * Maybe a method of having the nearest of any of the options
